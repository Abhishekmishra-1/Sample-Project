Write a Java code to develop a Music player application using do-while loop in Eclipse.

Note: The program has to be in the interactive mode.



Player must be on if and only if the battery level is greater than 30% and battery percentage will gets reduced by 5% after playing a song completely.



Input has to be the battery level and the total number of songs. Once you give these two inputs the output has to display "Music On

Playing Song 1

Do you want to play again? : Yes/No"



If user enters "yes" then output has to be 

"Invalid input string!!Enter Yes/No correctly!!

Do you want to play again? : Yes/No"



If user enters "Yes" then output has to be

"Playing Song 1

Do you want to play again? : Yes/No"



If user enters "No" then output has to be 

"Do you want to continue with next song?:Yes/No"



If user enters "Yes" then output has to be 

"Playing song 2

Do you want to play again? : Yes/No"



If user enters "No" then output has to be

"Do you want to continue with next song?:Yes/No"



If user enters "No" then output has to be

"Do you want to Stop Music?:Yes/No" 



If user enters "Yes" then output has to be 

"Music Player Stopped!!!"



If user enters "No" then output has to be

"RESTARTING" (If last played song is the last song of the play-list)

"RESUME" (else, Resume playing)



All these should happen when the battery level is greater than 30. If it is less than 30 then output has to be

"Low Battery!!!!

Music Player Stopped!!!"
